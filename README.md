# The Command Line
This week, we will learn the command line, which is a way of interacting with your computer without using your mousepad to complete tasks. For example, instead of manually creating a new folder, we will learn how to do that by typing a command. Knowing how to use the command line is an important first step towards learning how to program in Python. 

- Topics covered:
    - What is the command line and why is it relevant to Python?
    - Using git bash (Windows) or terminal (macOS) to perform basic computer commands such as creating a new folder or text file.
